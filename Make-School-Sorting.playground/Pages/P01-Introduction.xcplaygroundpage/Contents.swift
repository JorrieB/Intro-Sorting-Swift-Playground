# Sorting

When programming with collections of data, one of the most common operations performed is sorting. Just think of all the ways in which you use sorting in everyday software:

- Emails listed by date received
- Music albums shown alphabetically by title
- Address book contacts sorted by last or first name
- Facebook posts arranged by most recent post date
- To do items displayed in priority order

In each of these examples and in countless more, some collection of data is sorted so as to provide the viewer with a more useful representation of that data. After all, the computer doesn't really care how data is sorted - it's all the same data. But when we get into questions of how that data should be rendered or otherwise operated upon, sorting becomes a crucial factor.

Most sorting algorithms are comparison-based, which is to say that the sort is executed via multiple swaps of two elements. In the following sections, you'll first learn how to swap two elements in an array, and then start to build your first sorting function, using a deck of cards as an example.

## Swift Playgrounds

We will be using _Swift Playgrounds_ to teach you how to code. _Playgrounds_ are interactive coding environments that can contain instructions. The code you write gets run every time you make a change and visual output is displayed on the right. This makes it a great way to learn how to code!
