## Swapping

_Swapping_ two elements in an array sounds pretty simple: You take the element at the first chosen index in the array, and the element at the second chosen index, and assign them to eachothers' places. Here, we've written out such a swap function for you, but its implementation is wrong. Can you find what's wrong and fix it?

*/
extension Deck {
/*:
Note: Inside this class, the variable `cards` is an array of `Card` types (`Card` is a struct that we've defined ourselves, with two Int parameters, `suite` and `value`). You can access elements of this variable to manipulate the order of the cards.
*/
    public func swap(first: Int, _ second: Int) {
        
        // Student code here!
        cards[first] = cards[second]
        cards[second] = cards[first]
    }
/*:
Hint: You can save a value from an array to a _temporary_ variable by declaring and initializing it with `let x = ...`.
*/
}

/*:

Now in order to test our swap function, we'll call it from the special `Deck` object that we've made for you. Simply call `deck.swap(x, y)`, passing in two integers between 0 and 12 (since we have 13 cards in our array), like so:

    deck.swap(0, 1)

Remember that array indices start go from 0 to _one less than_ the length of the array!
*/

// Student code here!
deck.swap(1, 3)
